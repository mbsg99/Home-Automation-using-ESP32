The article is being published in collaboration with JLCPCB. It is one of the most experienced PCB manufacturers with more than a decade in the field of PCB prototype and fabrication, they are committed to meeting the needs of our customers from different industries in terms of quality, delivery, cost-effectiveness and any other demanding requests.

# Home-Automation-using-ESP32
Welcome to this article of Smart Home Automation, with help of this Smart Home Automation System you now have everything required to convert a simple home into smart home. Further you can add more functionality by various sensors such as temperature sensor, PIR Sensor, gas sensor and many more. They combine and exceed the best features and are easily installed without any modification in your existing electrical system.

# BC-547 Transistor
The BC547 transistor is an NPN transistor. A transistor is nothing but the transfer of resistance which is used for amplifying the current. A small current of the base terminal of this transistor will control the large current of emitter and base terminals. The main function of this transistor is to amplify as well as switching purposes. The maximum gain current of this transistor is 800A.
 
•	Pin1 (Collector): This pin is denoted with symbol ‘C’ and the flow of current will be through the collector terminal.
•	Pin2 (Base): This pin controls the transistor biasing.
•	Pin3 (Emitter): The current supplies out through emitter terminal

# Ordering the PCBs From JLCPCB
Full Process is shown using Screenshots Step-wise.

Now we have got the PCB design and it’s time to order the PCB’s. For that, you just have to go to JLCPCB.com, and click on “QUOTE NOW” button.

JLCPCB are also sponsor of this project. JLCPCB (ShenzhenJLC Electronics Co., Ltd.), is the largest PCB prototype enterprise in Chinaand a high-tech manufacturer specializing in quick PCB prototype and small-batch PCB production. You can order a minimum of 5 PCBs for just $2.

To get the PCB manufactured, upload the gerber file you downloaded in the last step. Upload the.zip file or you can also drag and drop the gerber files.

After uploading the zip file, you’ll see a success message at the bottom if the file is successfully uploaded.

You can review the PCB in the Gerber viewer to make sure everything is good. You can view both top and bottom of the PCB. After making sure our PCB looks good, we can now place the order at a reasonable price. You can order 5 PCBs for just $2 but if it’s your first order then you can get 5 PCBs for $2.

To place the order, click on “SAVE TO CART” button. My PCBs took 2 days to get manufactured and arrived within a week using DHL delivery option. PCBs were well packed and the quality was really good.
